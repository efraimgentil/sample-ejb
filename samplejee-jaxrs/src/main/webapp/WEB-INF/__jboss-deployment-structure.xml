			Solves a nasty bug in Jboss EAP 6.3, when your app has the jar with 
			the @Local interfaces and the EAR also has it, when u try to inject @Local 
			beans it will throw a IllegalStateException, and u will not be able to instantiate 
			your bean @Remote interfaces works fine apparently
			
			With this u will depend of the deployment of the ear early an then u can deploy your application
