			Solves a nasty bug in Jboss EAP 6.3, when your app has the jar with 
			the @Local interfaces and the EAR also has it, when u try to inject @Local 
			beans it will throw a IllegalStateException, and u will not be able to instantiate 
			your bean @Remote interfaces works fine apparently
			
			With this u will depend of the deployment of the ear early an then u can deploy your application 
			, the down side of this aproach is that when u undeploy your ejb your application will also be stoped
			
			Note: Aparently this is not a bug, the spec of the EJB 3.1 session 3.2.2 Local Clients says: 
			
			'''Access to an enterprise bean through the local client view is only required to be supported 
			   for local clients packaged within the same application as the enterprise bean that provides
			   the local client view. Compliant implementations of this specification may optionally support
			   access to the local client view of an enterprise bean from a local client packaged in a 
			   different application'''
