# Sample-EJB

Sample-EJB is a sample project using EJB and other JEE functionalities, the project has the idea to be used as a reference for how to use some functionalities of JEE, and to learn a bit more about the new spec JEE7 

# What is used

- Java 8
- Jboss EAP7(I'm using this, but i think that Wildfly 8 foward would not be a problem too)
- Running Jboss using standalone-full profile
- JEE7 (JAX-RS , JMS , JSF , EJB) so far just that
